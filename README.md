No! The plugin will host it for you on the minecraft server.

Make sure you have changed the needed values in the config. If this keeps on happening, join our discord and we can help you out there, or open an issue on our GitHub, this can be found [here](https://github.com/hwalker928/DiscordLink/issues).
